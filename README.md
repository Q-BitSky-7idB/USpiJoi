## ?? About the Project

### The Genesis

Needed tools that can manage files in a specific way: use minimal or specified place as buffer to load chunks one by one from remote source or big files and cut them or restore to original file.

### Key Features

* **Splitting (big) file:** Split file into chunks that can be moved to a size-restricted remote area.
* **Rewriting the same chunk-file:** Use a specific technique that is able to **save space** (or **economize space**) by using one file as a transfer buffer for other operations.
* **Joining chunks into the original file:** Can reverse the process of splitting from chunks.
* **Has a sequential execution mode:** Chunk creation or joining does not happen all at once, but **allows for loading the next chunk in its place** during both operations.
